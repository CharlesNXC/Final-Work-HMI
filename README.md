# 🎹 Digital Musical Instruments – PyQt5 Project

This is an interactive PyQt5-based desktop application that lets users play and record musical notes using three distinct virtual instruments:

- 🎹 Piano (with octave selector)
- 🎼 Xylophone
- 🕹️ Video Game Synth (custom icons + background)

The application supports live playback, recording, saving scores to `.txt`, and replaying saved performances. It also includes a dark/light theme toggle with persistent settings.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5 for GUI
- Threading and timers for non-blocking playback
- Custom widgets and styling with Qt Stylesheets

## 🤖 AI Use Transparency

I used **ChatGPT as a development assistant** throughout this project to:
- Debug layout and stylesheet issues in PyQt5
- Fix `QMessageBox` bugs in dark mode
- Simplify icon integration for buttons
- Help with structured code design and feature planning

Every line of code was reviewed, tested, and adjusted by me. AI was used **as a coding assistant**, not a replacement. This reflects how professional developers use tools to accelerate learning and polish, not to outsource creativity or understanding.

## 📂 Run the App

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the script:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
python Final_HMI2.py

# 🎹 Digital Musical Instruments – PyQt5 Project

We made this interactive PyQt5-based app that allows users to play and record music using three instruments:

- 🎹 Piano (with different octaves)
- 🎼 Xylophone
- 🕹️ Video Game

The app also allows the user to record, and save to `.txt`, and replaying saved performances.

- 📂 Load and play from a txt from a file
- 🎨 Possibility to switch between dark/light themes
- 🖼️ Icon-based note buttons in video game

## 🤖 Use of AI

We used ChatGPT to help us throughout this project to:
- Debug layout and stylesheet issues in PyQt5
- Fix some issues mainly with message boc and recording
- Help design and simplify the code for visual tools

However, we reviewed every line of code, tested, and modified them if needed.

To launch, use your coding app and make sure every of these files are in the same group.
